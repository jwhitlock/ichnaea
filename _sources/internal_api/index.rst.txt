Internal Code API
=================

This section describes the internal Python API's used throughout the code base.
For documentation on the public HTTP API please look at :ref:`service_api`.


Overview
========

The code is structured around a couple of larger functional areas in
addition to top-level helper modules.

There are two sub-packages `async` and `webapp` related to runtime
configuration and settings of the two process classes. `async` deals
with Celery and `webapp` deals with `gunicorn`.

The `api` sub-package deals with the implementation of the public
HTTP API. The `content` sub-package includes the public website content.
The `data` sub-package includes the data pipeline code, in the form of
asynchronous Celery tasks. The `models` sub-package deals with database
models and schema validation. `scripts` has the implementation of
command line scripts.
