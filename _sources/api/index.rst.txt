============
Services API
============

The service APIs accept data submission for geolocation stumbling as
well as reporting a location based on IP addresses, cell or WiFi networks.

New client developments should use the :ref:`api_region_latest`,
:ref:`api_geolocate_latest` or :ref:`api_geosubmit_latest` APIs.


API Access Keys
===============

You can anonymously submit data to the service without an API key via
any of the submission APIs.

You must identify your client to the service using an API key when
using one of the :ref:`api_region_latest`, :ref:`api_geolocate_latest`
or :ref:`api_transfer_latest` APIs.

If you want or need to specify an API key, you need to be provide
it as a query argument in the request URI in the form::

    https://location.services.mozilla.com/<API>?key=<API_KEY>

Each API key can be rate limited per calendar day, but the default is
to allow an unlimited number of requests per day.


Errors
======

Each of the supported APIs can return specific error responses.
In addition there are some general error responses.


Invalid API Key
---------------

If an API key was required but none or no valid key was given, the service
responds with a `keyInvalid` message with a HTTP 400 error code:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "error": {
            "errors": [{
                "domain": "usageLimits",
                "reason": "keyInvalid",
                "message": "Missing or invalid API key."
            }],
            "code": 400,
            "message": "Invalid API key"
        }
    }


API Key Limit
-------------

API keys can optionally be rate limited. If the limit for a specific
API key is exceeded, the service responds with a `dailyLimitExceeded`
message with a HTTP 403 error code:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "error": {
            "errors": [{
                "domain": "usageLimits",
                "reason": "dailyLimitExceeded",
                "message": "You have exceeded your daily limit."
            }],
            "code": 403,
            "message": "You have exceeded your daily limit."
        }
    }


Parse Error
-----------

If the client sends a malformed request, typically sending malformed
or invalid JSON, the service will respond with a `parseError` message
with a HTTP 400 error code:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "error": {
            "errors": [{
                "domain": "global",
                "reason": "parseError",
                "message": "Parse Error"
            }],
            "code": 400,
            "message": "Parse Error"
        }
    }


Service Error
-------------

If there is a transient service side problem, the service might respond
with HTTP 5xx error codes with unspecified HTTP bodies.

This might happen if part of the service is down or unreachable. If you
encounter any 5xx responses, you should retry the request at a later
time. As a service side problem is unlikely to be resolved immediately,
you should wait a couple of minutes before retrying the request for the
first time and a couple of hours later if there's still a problem.


APIs
====

Historically the service first offered the custom :ref:`api_search` and
:ref:`api_submit` APIs. Later it was decided to also implement the
:ref:`api_geolocate` API to lessen the burden on clients that want to
support multiple location services. As an extension to this the
:ref:`api_geosubmit` API was added to offer a consistent way to contribute
back data to the service. Afterwards the :ref:`api_region` API was added
and :ref:`api_geosubmit2` superseded its version 1 counterpart. Finally
the :ref:`api_transfer` API was added.
