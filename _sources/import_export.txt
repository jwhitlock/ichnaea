====================
Data Import / Export
====================

Ichnaea supports automatic, periodic CSV (comma separated values) export
of aggregate cell data (position estimates) and periodic import of
the same type of data from the :term:`OpenCellID` project.

The data exchange format was created in collaboration with the
:term:`OpenCellID` project.

Records should be written one record to a line, with CRLF (0x0D 0x0A)
as line separator.

A value should be written as an empty field -- two adjacent commas, for
example -- rather than being omitted.

The first five fields (radio to cell) jointly identify a unique logical cell
network. The remaining fields contain information about this network.

The data format does not specify the means and exact algorithms by which the
position estimate or range calculation was done. The algorithms might be
unique and changing for each source of the data, though both ichnaea and
:term:`OpenCellID` currently use similar and comparable techniques.

The fields in the CSV file are as follows:

Cell Fields
-----------

``radio``

    Network type. One of the strings `GSM`,
    `UMTS` (for WCMDA networks) or `LTE`.

``mcc``

    Mobile Country Code. An integer, for example `505`, the code for Australia.

``net``

    For GSM, UMTS and LTE networks, this is the mobile network code (MNC).
    An integer, for example `4`, the MNC used by Vodaphone in the Netherlands.

``area``

    For GSM and UMTS networks, this is the location area code (LAC). For LTE
    networks, this is the tracking area code (TAC).
    An integer, for example `2035`.

``cell``

    For GSM and LTE networks, this is the cell id or cell identity (CID).
    For UMTS networks this is the UTRAN cell id, which is the concatenation
    of 2 bytes of radio network controller (RNC) code and 2 bytes of cell id.
    An integer, for example `32345`.

``unit``

    For UMTS networks, this is the primary scrambling code (PSC). For LTE
    networks, this is the physical cell id (PCI). For GSM networks,
    this is empty. An integer, for example `312`.

``lon``

    Longitude in degrees between -180.0 and 180.0 using the WSG 84 reference
    system. A floating point number, for example `52.3456789`.

``lat``

    Latitude in degrees between -90.0 and 90.0 using the WSG 84 reference
    system. A floating point number, for example `-10.034`.

``range``

    Estimate of radio range, in meters. This is an estimate on how large each
    cell area is, as a radius around the estimated position and is based on
    the :term:`observations` or a knowledgeable source.
    An integer, for example `2500`.

``samples``

    Total number of :term:`observations` used to calculate the estimated
    position, range and averageSignal. An integer, for example `1200`.

``changeable``

    Whether or not this cell is a position estimate based on
    :term:`observations`, and therefore subject to change in the future,
    or is an exact location entered from a knowledgeable source. A boolean
    value, encoded as either `1` (for "changeable") or `0` (for "exact").

``created``

    Timestamp of the time when this record was first created. An integer,
    counting seconds since the UTC Unix Epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
    For example, `1406204196`, which is the timestamp for 2014-07-24T12:16:36Z.

``updated``

    Timestamp of the time when this record was most recently modified. An
    integer, counting seconds since the UTC Unix Epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
    For example, `1406204196`, which is the timestamp for 2014-07-24T12:16:36Z.

``averageSignal``

    Average signal strength from all observations for the cell network.
    An integer value, in dBm. For example, `-72`.

    This field is only used by the :term:`OpenCellID` project and has
    been used historically as a hint towards the quality of the
    position estimate.


Import
------

If you run your own version of the ichnaea software, you can either
regularly import the OCID data or manually import the cell data from
another source into your own database.

For the automatic import, see :ref:`the configuration document <config>`,
specifically the `[import:ocid]` section.

For manually importing a cell export into your own database, a
`location_load` command line tool is provided. Run it via:

.. code-block:: bash

    location_load --help

to see the available options.
