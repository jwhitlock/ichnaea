``Ichnaea`` is a service to provide geolocation coordinates
from other sources of data (Bluetooth, cell or WiFi networks, GeoIP, etc.).
It is using both :term:`Cell-ID` and Wi-Fi based positioning (:term:`WPS`)
approaches.

Mozilla hosts an instance of this service, called the `Mozilla Location
Service <https://wiki.mozilla.org/CloudServices/Location>`_
(:term:`MLS`).

You can interact with the service in two ways:

- If you know where you are, submit information about the radio environment
  to the service to increase its quality.

- or locate yourself, based on the radio environment around you.
