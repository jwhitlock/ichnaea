    Cell-ID
    Cell ID
    Cell IDs
    CGI
        `Cell ID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_ID>`_ describes both
        a globally unique identifier for any logical cell network, as well
        as an approach to locate devices based on prior knowledge of the
        positions of these cell networks. Sometimes the term cell global
        identity (CGI) can also be found. See also :term:`WPS`.

    CID
        A term describing the GSM or WCDMA cell id, LTE cell identity
        or CDMA base station id. All these form the last part of the
        globally unique :term:`Cell ID`.

    decimal degree
    decimal degrees
        `Decimal degrees <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees>`_
        express latitude and longitude coordinates as decimal fractions,
        for example `10.1234567`.

    MLS
        The `Mozilla Location Service <https://location.services.mozilla.com/>`_
        is an instance of the ichnaea software hosted by Mozilla.

    observation
    observations
        An observation describes the data collected about a single
        :term:`station` identified by its unique global identifier,
        additional data about the :term:`station` like signal strength
        readings and :term:`report` data about the position of the
        :term:`station`.

    OpenCellID
    OCID
        `OpenCellID <http://opencellid.org/>`_ is a collaborative
        project to create a free worldwide database of :term:`Cell IDs`.

    report
    reports
        A report describes the data collected in a single reading,
        consisting of data about the position and movement at the time
        of taking the reading and data about multiple :term:`stations`
        observable at the time. For example one report could contain
        information about one cell network and 10 WiFi networks.

    station
    stations
        A term referring to any radio signal emitting stationary device,
        or the radio network it emits. Examples of what we call stations
        are WiFi access points / WiFi network, cell towers / cell networks
        and Bluetooth Beacons / Bluetooth LE networks.

    Web Mercator
    WSG84
        `WSG 84 Web Mercator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator>`_
        refers to the geographic map projection used throughout this project.
        The latitude and longitude values use
        `WSG 84 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System>`_
        as the coordinate reference system.

    WiPS
    WPS
        `Wi-Fi based positioning system
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system>`_
        describes a system of using prior knowledge about the location
        of WiFi networks, identified by their globally unique BSSID/MAC
        address, to position devices. See also :term:`Cell ID`.
