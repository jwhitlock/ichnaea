  <div class="section" id="accuracy">
<span id="id1"></span><h1>Accuracy<a class="headerlink" href="#accuracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Depending on the signal standard, we can promise different sorts of accuracy.</p>
<p>Underlying this is the assumption that we have enough data about the
area at all. With no or too little data we’ll have to fallback to less
accurate data sources. Bluetooth is the most accurate, followed by
WiFi and than cell based estimation using single cells, multiple cells
or cell location areas. If all else fails GeoIP serves as a general fallback.</p>
<div class="section" id="bluetooth-wifi">
<h2>Bluetooth / WiFi<a class="headerlink" href="#bluetooth-wifi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bluetooth and WiFi networks have a fairly limited range. Bluetooth
low-energy beacons typically just a couple meters and WiFi networks up
to 100 meters. With obstacles like walls and people in the way, these
get even lower.</p>
<p>But this data can be skewed when the device in question is moving.
It takes some time to do a network scan and devices tend to cache this
information heavily. So there can be a time delta of tens of seconds
between when a network was actually seen and when it is reported to
the application layer. With a fast moving device this can lead to
inaccuracies of a couple kilometers. WiFi networks tend to show up
in scan long after they are out of reach, if the the device was
actually connected to these networks.</p>
<p>This means position estimates based on WiFi networks are usually
accurate to 100 meters. If a lot of networks are available in the area
accuracy tends to increase to about 10 or 20 meters. Bluetooth networks
tend to be accurate to about 10 meters.</p>
<p>One challenge that’s particular severe in Bluetooth and WiFi networks
are all the constantly moving networks, for example those installed on
buses or trains or in the form of hotspot enabled mobile phones or
tablets. So movement detection and detecting inconsistencies between
observed data and the database world view are important considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gsm-cells">
<h2>GSM Cells<a class="headerlink" href="#gsm-cells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In GSM networks one typically has only access to the unique cell id of
the serving cell. In GSM networks the phone does not know the full cell
ids of any neighboring cells, unless it associates with the new cell as
part of a hand-over, forgetting the cell id of the old cell.</p>
<p>So we are limited to a basic <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-cell-id"><span class="xref std std-term">Cell-ID</span></a> approach, meaning we assume
that the user is at the center of the current GSM cell area and use the
cell radius as the accuracy.</p>
<p>GSM cells are restricted to a maximum range of 35km, but there are rare
exceptions using the GSM extended range of 120km.</p>
<p>In more populated places the cell sizes are typically much smaller,
but generally accuracy will be in the tens of kilometer range.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wcdma-cells">
<h2>WCDMA Cells<a class="headerlink" href="#wcdma-cells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In WCDMA networks neighboring cell information can be available. But
limitations in chipset drivers, the radio interface layer and the
operating systems often hide this data from application code. Or
only partially expose the cell identifiers, for example only exposing
the carrier and primary scrambling code of the neighboring cells.</p>
<p>So in most cases we are limited to the same approach as for GSM cells.
The typical cell sizes of WCDMA cells are much smaller, which practically
leads to a better accuracy. But WCDMA cells in rural areas can have a
larger radius than GSM cells and we observed cells sizes of 60-70km.</p>
<p>In urban areas we should typically see accuracy in the 1 to 10 kilometer
range.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lte-cells">
<h2>LTE Cells<a class="headerlink" href="#lte-cells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>LTE networks are similar to WCDMA networks and the same restriction on
neighboring cells applies. Instead of a primary scrambling code LTE uses
a physical cell id, which for our purposes has similar characteristics.</p>
<p>LTE cells are again often even smaller than WCDMA cells which leads to
better accuracies.</p>
<p>LTE networks also expose a time based distance metric in the form of
the timing advance. While we currently don’t use this information, in
the future it has the potential to significantly improve position
estimates based on multiple cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="geoip">
<h2>GeoIP<a class="headerlink" href="#geoip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The accuracy of GeoIP depends a lot on the region the user is in.
In the US GeoIP can be fairly accurate and often places the
user in the right city or metropolitan area. In many other parts of
the world GeoIP is only accurate to the region level.</p>
<p>Typical GeoIP accuracies are either in the 25 km range for city based
estimates or multiple hundred kilometers for region based estimates.</p>
<p>IP version 6 has the chance to improve this situation, as the need for
private carrier networks and network address translation decreases.
But so far this hasn’t made any measurable impact and most traffic
is still restricted to IP version 4.</p>
